Dose distributions
--------------------
The dose distributions that can be visualized in Kali MC by default were pre-calculated using penEasy
2020 :footcite:p:`sempauPENELOPEbasedSystemAutomated2011`, based on PENELOPE
2018 :footcite:p:`nuclearenergyagencyPENELOPE2018Code2019`.

Monte Carlo calculated Phase Space Files in IAEA format providing the aforementioned absorbed dose distributions are
available online :footcite:p:`ayala_2024_14143380`.

R\ :sub:`90` \ values
----------------------

The R\ :sub:`90` \ values are derived from Percentage Depth Doses (PDDs) determined at Gregorio Mara침칩n hospital, Madrid.

Output factors
---------------

The output factors introduced in Kali MC come from measurements at Gregorio Mara침칩n hospital, Madrid.
