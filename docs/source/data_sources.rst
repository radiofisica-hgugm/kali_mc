Dose distributions
--------------------
The dose distributions that can be visualized in Kali MC, they have been pre-calculated with penEasy
2020 :footcite:p:`sempauPENELOPEbasedSystemAutomated2011`, based in PENELOPE
2018 :footcite:p:`nuclearenergyagencyPENELOPE2018Code2019`.

R\ :sub:`90` \ values
----------------------

The R\ :sub:`90` \ values are derived from Percentage Depth Doses (PDDs) determined at Gregorio Mara침칩n hospital, Madrid.

Output factors
---------------

The output factors introduced in Kali MC come from measurements at Gregorio Mara침칩n hospital, Madrid.


.. note::

    We are currently working on a Kali MC version that will allow the user to select between measured and Monte Carlo
    calculated output factors and R\ :sub:`90` \ values.
